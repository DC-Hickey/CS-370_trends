## 7-1 Project 2: Treasure Hunt Game
### Project Overview:
> *Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?*

For this project, the primary task was to implement the Q-learning algorithm for a path finding AI pirate within an existing treasure hunting game. The files *GameExperience.py*, *TresureMaze.py*, and *TresureHuntGame.ipynb* were provided by SNHU, with *TresureHuntGame.ipynd* serving as the starter code for *Hickey_Dan_ProjectTwo.ipynb*, where the Q-learning algorithm was created using industry standard practices. Alongside creating the Q-learning algorithm, one of the requirements during development was the optimization of the training process by setting the appropriate number of epochs for 100% completion.

### Course Reflection:
> *Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science.* 

Generally, the job of a computer scientist is summarized as creating software solutions for existing problems, be it for a client or for a problem they themselves identified. However, I believe this course emphasizes the often-overlooked aspect of computer science, the task of understanding the technology. While a general understanding of technology is desired, and understanding the technology being worked with is vital, one of the more important attributes a computer scientist can possess is a persistent inquisitiveness towards technological advancements. Reflected through the pursuit of understanding of upcoming advances and trends, this inquisitiveness, and the incorporation of newfound techniques into their problem-solving repertoire, is what ensures relevance and adaptability in an ever-changing field.

With the age of Artificial Intelligence quickly approaching, having a demystified understanding of how they function and how they differ from humans is incredibly important for working with AI in any capacity, whether it be working on AI advancements or working alongside AI. Alongside a basic understanding of AI, having an understanding of the ethical issues revolving around AI’s incorporation into society and the sourcing of training data serves to strengthen the integrity of computer scientists. Ethical considerations are important to the fairness towards users, and the overall well-being a society in which the integration and importance of technology is constantly being strengthened.
